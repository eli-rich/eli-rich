# Hi, I'm Eli :)

**Hobbyist programmer | Systems & Backend | Web Development | Cybersecurity Student**

I've been writing code since I was 10, starting with Windows batch scripts. Then I learned Python, fell in love with JavaScript, and now spend most of my time in Go and C. Studying cybersecurity at Coastal Alabama Community College.

Fair warning: my GitHub is not an accurate representation of what I actually work on. Most of my stuff lives in `~/projects` and will probably stay there forever. The repos you see here are just the ones that I accidentally set to public.

## What I'm Into

- **Language Exploration**: If it compiles (or interprets), I've probably tried it. Go, Rust, C, TypeScript, Python, Zig, Elixir, Odin, Swift... you know, the _really_ cool ones 😎
  - Legitimately proficient in Go and JavaScript/TypeScript. As for the rest? I can get them to compile :)
- **Systems Programming**: Low-level stuff, performance optimization, figuring out how things _actually_ work
- **Backend Development**: Building fast, reliable server-side applications (the kind without flashy UIs to show off)
- **Security**: Vulnerability analysis, reverse engineering, and pretending I understand assembly
- **Game Engines**: I've built a complete Connect 4 engine that'll beat you most of the time

## Projects Worth Checking Out

- **[goc4](https://github.com/eli-rich/goc4)** - A complete Connect 4 engine written in Go
  - [Try to beat it](https://connect4.werichardson.com) (spoiler: you probably won't)
  - Or check out the [source code](https://github.com/eli-rich/c4app) for the deployment
- **[radar](https://github.com/eli-rich/radar)** - Automatically upload screenshots (or any files) to an S3/R2 bucket
- **[1brc-go](https://github.com/eli-rich/1brc-go)** - One Billion Row Challenge implementation in Go
- **[1brc-gen](https://github.com/eli-rich/1brc-gen)** - Generates test data for the above

I'm also pretty solid with TypeScript and frontend frameworks, but terrible at actual _design_, so my UIs look... unique!

## Current Status

Writing more projects that won't make it to GitHub, learning C (for real this time), studying cybersecurity. Also keeping up with whatever JavaScript framework dropped in the last 30 minutes.

## Tech I Work With

- **Languages**: Go · TypeScript/JavaScript · C · Python (and whatever language I decided to learn that month)
- **Tools**: [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (but I cheat with [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)) · Linux daily driver btw
- **Currently Learning**: Advanced systems programming, network security, exploit development
- **Want to Learn**: Interpreter and compiler development
